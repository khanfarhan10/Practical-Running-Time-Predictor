# Practical-Running-Time-Predictor
Various types of running times exist for analysis of algorithmic efficiency.  
This research presents a more empirical approach to the problem for the practical measurements of the actual running time of algorithms by considering a plethora of randomized inputs Rn and then fitting a regression curve in n to the algorithm of practical time complexity υ (n).  
This will also provide us the productivity factor η which will quantify the universal running time with respect to the asymptotic worst case complexity and evaluate the efficiency of the given algorithm with the help of leading coefficients.  
This research will also help us compare similar algorithms in a mathematically modeled manner.
